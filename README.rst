Vuejs-Python
============

This project aims to create various examples showing how to work
with vuejs and python based technologies. As vuejs may be integrated
in different ways, with different advantages for each approach,
having these examples are ideal for the brave-of-heart.

flask-vue
---------

## quickstart

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml up

**flask-vue** is the first project made. It shows how to
use flask and vuejs to build a non-SPA (single page
application). This approach is more appropriate for
those with little experience using js/node build tools
like webpack_ and browserify_. You'll mostly have to
handle python and js code. Another important advantage
is that most flask "resources" will still work
out-of-the-box, like debug toolbar and csrf protection.

A disvantage for this approach is that it is much
less flexible, integrates poorly with other
javascript libraries, less performatic, has cache
invalidation issues and is not appropriate for
larger projects. Depending of how you implement
the frontend, you may also see some flickering.

So, how does the **flask-vue** was built? Basically
you have a flask application with support to schemas
that loads your vue framework in the index.html page,
mounts your Vue element, queries a endpoint and builds
your view. Even though this approach produces flickering,
it is quite simple to implement. Let's focus on a few
highlights:

- **The javascript is generated by webassets**, which converts
  the coffee files on access. Quite convenient.
- **Marshmallow is used for serialization**, as it is capable
  of loading requests into python objects/sqlalchemy objects and
  serialize them back.
- **Ajax requests are treated by plain views**, with exception
  to the rest api, which is handle by a custom Resource class,
  which provides a rest api interface.

Be warned that there are a few broken links here and there AND
pagination is not implemented visually.
